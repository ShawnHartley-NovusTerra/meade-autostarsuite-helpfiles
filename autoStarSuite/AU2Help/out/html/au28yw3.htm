<P><A NAME="xmf_cc"></A><B>The Library List View</B></P>

<P>The Library List View displays a list of objects that are currently in Autostar Update’s memory.  Use this list view to manipulate, sort and edit objects prior to transferring them to the Autostar Handbox.  Consider this view (on the left half of the screen) as your "Master Library" which you build by combining objects from numerous sources, such as the handbox, the www, or manually entered data.  It is possible to store tens of thousands of objects in your Library, and to have several different libraries.  However, since you could not possibly observe all of these objects in a single outing, and the handbox space is limited, you should selectively <A HREF="au20i49.htm">Transfer</A> objects to the handbox collection, sort them into a logical order, and then <A HREF="au20e73.htm">Send</A> that data to the handbox for use during your next observing session.</P>

<P>You may <A HREF="au29393.htm">Open</A> an existing library (*.AUD) file from a local disk drive, or you may create a <A HREF="au24sa7.htm">New</A> library document.  Data can be added to a library manually through the "EDIT" - <A HREF="au2348m.htm">New</A> command, by <A HREF="au20ujn.htm">transferring</A> data from the <A HREF="au24xf2.htm">Handbox List View</A>, or by <A HREF="au26cnz.htm">Importing</A> data from one of several different file formats.</P>

<P>Autostar allows manipulation of six types of objects: <A HREF="au22f8k.htm">asteroids</A>, <A HREF="au20d0f.htm">comets</A>, <A HREF="au246t3.htm">satellites</A>, <A HREF="au2131l.htm">landmarks</A>, <A HREF="au214fd.htm">user objects</A> (which may be customized with the Autostar II) and <A HREF="au28mb3.htm">tours</A>. To select the object type you wish to view and/or manipulate, choose one of the six buttons located at the top of either list view.</P>

<P>Since amateur astronomy is such a popular pastime, there are numerous sources on the www where astronomical data can be obtained.  Visit Meade Instruments Corporation’s web site for links to some of these resources.</P>

<P>Once your Library collection is built, you may <A HREF="au27i7i.htm">Save</A> or <A HREF="au28ujn.htm">Save As</A> to store that library for future use with Autostar and Autostar Update.</P>
