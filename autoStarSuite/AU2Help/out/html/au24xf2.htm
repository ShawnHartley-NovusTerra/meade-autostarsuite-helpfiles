<P><A NAME="71i.4."></A><B>The Handbox List View</B></P>

<P>The Handbox List View contains the data that will be <A HREF="au20e73.htm">Sent</A> to the Autostar Handbox, or that has just been <A HREF="au27msy.htm">Retrieved</A> from the Autostar Handbox.  Consider this view (on the right half of the screen) as your "Temporary Holding Area" for objects that are about to be <A HREF="au20e73.htm">Sent</A> to the handbox.  The order that the objects are displayed in the Handbox List View is the same order that they will appear in the Autostar Handbox.  So prior to sending the data, click on the column headings to sort the data in a way that is meaningful to you, such as by Name, Right Ascension, Absolute Magnitude, etc.</P>

<P>Autostar allows manipulation of six types of objects: <A HREF="au22f8k.htm">asteroids</A>, <A HREF="au20d0f.htm">comets</A>, <A HREF="au246t3.htm">satellites</A>, <A HREF="au2131l.htm">landmarks</A>, <A HREF="au214fd.htm">user objects</A> (which may be customized with the Autostar II) and <A HREF="au28mb3.htm">tours</A>. To select the object type you wish to view and/or manipulate, choose one of the six buttons located at the top of either list view.</P>

<P>You may <A HREF="au23rjk.htm">Save</A> the data in the handbox list and <A HREF="au22muw.htm">Load</A> it into the handbox list at a later date.  </P>

<P>Since sending data to the handbox will erase all the objects already in the handbox, if you do not wish to permanently lose this data, <A HREF="au22351.htm">Retrieve</A> it first, <A HREF="au23rjk.htm">Save</A> it to the hard disk, and then proceed with the transfer.   </P>

<P>Whenever data is <A HREF="au20e73.htm">Sent</A> to or <A HREF="au27msy.htm">Retrieved</A> from the handbox, the contents of the handbox list are automatically saved to a backup file, so you can undo any changes made by choosing the File Menu Item <A HREF="au22eat.htm">Restore Data</A>.</P>
