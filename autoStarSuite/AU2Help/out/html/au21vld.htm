<P><A NAME="12n_8l1"></A><B>Operating Instructions - #505 Connector Cable Kit</B></P>

<P>The #505 Connector Cable Kit provides access to three Autostar operations:</P>

<P>·Telescope Control: Use a personal computer (PC) to directly control a Meade Autostar-compatible telescope through the use of an astronomical software program with telescope control capabilities such as Meade Epoch 2000sk™ Sky Software.</P>

<P>·Download from a PC: Download a new version of the Autostar software or object information (e.g., new satellite orbital parameters) from the Meade web site (www.meade.com) through a PC to Autostar.</P>

<P>·Download and Clone from Autostar: Transfer user-defined object information or new Autostar software from one Autostar Computer Controller to another.</P>

<P><B>PARTS LIST</B></P>

<P>The #505 Connector Cable Kit is supplied with the following:</P>

<P>·3-foot, 4-pin to 4-pin cable</P>

<P>·6-foot, 4-pin to 6-pin cable</P>

<P>·6-pin to RS-232 serial interface adapter</P>

<P>The 3-foot cable connects two Autostars, while the 6-foot cable connects an Autostar and a PC using the interface adapter.</P>

<P>CAUTION: Do not connect either cable to the AUX port on the telescope’s computer control panel or damage may occur to the cable connector.</P>

<P><B>TELESCOPE CONTROL</B></P>

<P>A powerful feature of Autostar is that it serves as an interface between an astronomical software program, such as Meade Epoch 2000sk Sky Software, and a Meade digital telescope. </P>

<P>NOTE: The software program must be compatible with the LX200-series telescope to be compatible with Autostar.</P>

<P>To use this function, complete the following procedure:</P>

<P>1.Verify that telescope and computer power are OFF.</P>

<P>2.Connect the serial interface adapter (1, Fig. 1) to the RS–232 port on a PC.</P>

<P>3.Connect the 6-pin end of the 6-foot cable (2, Fig. 1) to the serial interface adapter, then the 4-pin end to the RS-232 port at the base of Autostar (3, Fig. 1).</P>

<P>4.Connect the Autostar coil cord between the HBX port (4, Fig. 1) on the telescope computer control panel and the coil cord connector port on Autostar.</P>

<P>5.Apply power to the telescope and computer, then complete basic Autostar initialization as detailed in the Autostar instruction manual.</P>

<P>6.Be sure that the computer Com Port is configured to the following specifications:</P>

<P>·Baud Rate9600</P>

<P>·Data Bits8</P>

<P>·ParityNone</P>

<P>·Stop bit1</P>

<P>·Flow ControlNone</P>

<P>7.Complete telescope alignment as detailed in the Autostar instruction manual.</P>

<P>Telescope control can now be accessed using a PC astronomical software program. Follow instructions provided with the software to provide PC telescope control (if using Meade Epoch 2000sk Sky Software the telescope is controlled using the Auto Tracking function).</P>

<P>NOTE: The Autostar GO TO function is still active when connected to an astronomical software program, allowing control either from the PC or Autostar.</P>

<P>If you have a question concerning use of the #505 Connector Cable Kit, call the Meade Instruments Customer Service Department at (949) 451-1450, or fax at (949) 451-1460. Customer Service hours are 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM, Pacific Time, Monday through Friday.</P>
