<P>A tour is a script that contains many objects, usually grouped under a theme, such as "Messier Objects" or "Tonight’s Best".  Tours can be downloaded from Meade’s website as well as from third-party sites, or can be written by the user.</P>

<P>With the addition of the Autostar II, several new features were incorporated into the script syntax for tours, such as lunar features and Hipparcos stars.  Tours incorporating such features are referred to as EXTENDED tours, and are represented by a "Yes" in the "Extended" column of the tours list.  Extended tours will only be available in future releases of the Autostar II handbox, and attempts to send them to an Autostar 494/495/497 handbox are not be allowed.  Basic tours (represented by a "No" in the "Extended" column) can be sent to any handbox type.</P>
