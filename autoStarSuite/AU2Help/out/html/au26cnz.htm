<P>To import data from a variety of file types into your <A HREF="au28yw3.htm">Library List View</A>, choose the Import command from the File Menu.  A file selection dialog box opens and allows you to select the file you wish to import.  The following file types are available:</P>

<P>*.txtYou MUST specify the type of object to import</P>

<P>*.tleOnly Satellite data (no object selection necessary)</P>

<P>*.romYou MUST specify the type of object to import</P>

<P>*.mtfOnly Tour data (no object selection necessary)</P>

<P>If you are importing a *.txt or *.rom file, you must select the appropriate object type from the list box.</P>

<P>Two options are available during an import operation:</P>

<P>1)Delete all existing objects first – when checked, this option will delete all objects of the selected type from the destination list view first.  Only the newly-imported objects will remain after this operation.  If this option is not checked, new objects will be added to the existing list, but will not overwrite any objects of the same name.</P>

<P>2)Only import objects that already exist – when checked, this option will compare each imported object to each object in the destination list view.  If a match is found (based on the name), the object will be imported and overwrite the existing object.  If not match is found, the object will not be imported.  This is a useful option for updating the data in existing objects without adding or deleting any objects.</P>

<P>After you have selected the file name, object type (if applicable) and the options, click on the IMPORT button to complete the operation.</P>

<P>An alternative way of importing data is to drag the file’s icon from your Windows desktop to the destination list view.</P>
