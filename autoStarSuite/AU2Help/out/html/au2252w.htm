<P><A NAME="1nh3i3x"></A><B>Custom User Objects (Object Data Type – Autostar II Only)</B></P>

<P><B>To Manipulate Custom User Objects, Revision 1.3o or higher of the Autostar II Software is required.</B></P>

<P>A custom user object is ANY celestial object that a user defines with the Autostar Handbox. Just like normal <A HREF="au214fd.htm">User Objects</A>, each Custom User Object has a name, Right Ascension and Declination as the first 3 fields.  However, a custom user object may have up to 6 additional fields of 15 characters each (including label and data) which are defined by the user.  </P>

<P>There may be up to 20 different Catalogs of Custom User Objects, which are essentially 20 new Object Data Types in addition to the 6 standard types.  Each Catalog must have a unique name, and is required to start with the object name, RA and DEC fields.  Catalogs can only be defined through the Autostar Update software, and once they are defined, they cannot be altered, although the object data within them may be altered.  </P>

<P>To select a Custom User Object from within the handbox, look under Object-&gt;Deep Sky, and any custom catalogs that have been defined will be displayed along with the normal Deep Sky objects.</P>

<P>To select/ edit/ create a Custom User Object from within the Autostar Update Software, right-mouse-click the User Object type button in either list view and select the desired Catalog to display.  </P>

<P>For information on how to create new Custom User Object Catalogs, see <A HREF="au2773h.htm">How To Create Custom User Catalogs</A>.  For information on how to manage Custom User Objects, see <A HREF="au298rx.htm">Managing Custom User Catalogs</A>.</P>
