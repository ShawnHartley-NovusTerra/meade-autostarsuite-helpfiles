<P><A NAME="how_to_import"></A><B>How To Import Satellite, Comet, Asteroid And Tour Data</B></P>

<P>Objects such as Satellites, Comets, Asteroids and Tours may be loaded into the <A HREF="au28yw3.htm">Library List View</A> from sources other than standard Autostar Update Data (*.aud) files.  You may find these additional data from many sources on the World Wide Web, including Meade Instruments Corporation’s Web Site.  The following are file types that can be imported into the Autostar Update:</P>

<P>*.txtAny object may be imported as a Text file.</P>

<P>*.tleSatellite data may be imported as a TLE file</P>

<P>*.romAny object may be imported as a ROM file</P>

<P>*.mtfTour data may be imported as an MTF file</P>

<P>To import any of the above files, choose the <A HREF="au26cnz.htm">Import</A> command from the File Menu, or drag the file from your Windows desktop to the destination list view in the program.  Note: If <A HREF="au279td.htm">Real Time Mode</A> is activated, the drop destination is limited to the <A HREF="au28yw3.htm">Library List View</A>.</P>

<P>Two options are available during an import operation:</P>

<P>1)Delete all existing objects first – when checked, this option will delete all objects of the selected type from the destination list view first.  Only the newly-imported objects will remain after this operation.  If this option is not checked, new objects will be added to the existing list, but will not overwrite any objects of the same name.</P>

<P>2)Only import objects that already exist – when checked, this option will compare each imported object to each object in the destination list view.  If a match is found (based on the name), the object will be imported and overwrite the existing object.  If not match is found, the object will not be imported.  This is a useful option for updating the data in existing objects without adding or deleting any objects.</P>
