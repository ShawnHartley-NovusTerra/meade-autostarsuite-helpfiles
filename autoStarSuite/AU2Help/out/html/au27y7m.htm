<P>If you encounter any problems while upgrading the software in your handbox, the flash memory in your handbox or telescope may become damaged, rendering the system non-functional (<I>e.g.,</I> the handbox does not display anything when powered on, displays garbage characters, etc.).  This typically occurs if an upgrade command is interrupted in any way before completion.  </P>

<P>Fortunately there is an easy way to restore the damaged flash memory:  Connect the handbox to the telescope and the PC with the telescope power off.  </P>

<P>For a #495 or #497 Autostar, simultaneously hold down the "ENTER" and the Scroll Down key, (<B>Hint:</B> Do not confuse with the Down Arrow key) and turn the telescope power on while holding these keys.  The handbox displays "FLASH LOAD – READY" to indicate that you may now transfer data to and from the handbox.</P>

<P>For an Autostar II, press the "9" button three times immediately AFTER applying power to the handbox.  The handbox displays "Downloading… DO NOT POWER OFF" to indicate that you may now transfer data to and from the handbox.  NOTE THAT THE AUTOSTAR II DEFAULTS TO 9600 BAUD IN SAFE MODE.  This is the best transmission speed to ensure reliable data transfer.  However, if you wish to increase the speed, click the <A HREF="au29s4y.htm">Connect</A> button first, then Options-&gt;<A HREF="au24ilz.htm"> Max Baud Rate</A>.</P>

<P>Click on the <A HREF="au27qci.htm">Upgrade Autostar Software Now</A> button to transfer the latest software to the handbox and repair the damage.  Note: The "Erase User Banks" check box is available for the Autostar II only.  This option will erase all user information, including site information, owner information, user objects, telescope calibrations, etc.  Do not use this option unless you are having severe problems uploading your handbox.</P>

<P>All other Autostar Update functions work normally in this mode (<I>e.g., </I>you can save user downloads, etc.).</P>
