<P><B>To Manipulate Custom User Objects, Revision 1.3o or higher of the Autostar II Software is required.</B></P>

<P>To transfer <A HREF="au2252w.htm">Custom User Objects</A> from the <A HREF="au28yw3.htm">Library List View</A> to the <A HREF="au24xf2.htm">Handbox List View</A> or vice-versa, use the <A HREF="au21vcj.htm">Transfer Buttons</A> on the main dialog box in much the same way as they would be used with normal <A HREF="au214fd.htm">User Objects</A>.  However, due to potential variations between the source and destination catalog definitions, the following rules apply:</P>

<P>텲ven though catalogs may be given original names, they still maintain their numerical identities.  For example, a catalog that had a default name of "Undefined13" before being defined will be treated as the 13th Custom Catalog.  Thus, when either User Object type button is clicked, the 13th Custom Catalog will be displayed in both list views even if it is not defined identically in both list views.</P>

<P>텶f the source and destination list views have identical definitions of the catalog displayed, the "Transfer Selected" and "Transfer Refresh" buttons will work normally.</P>

<P>텶f the source list view catalog has been defined but the corresponding destination catalog is empty, the "Transfer Selected" buttons will create the catalog definition in the destination list before copying the objects, whereas the "Transfer Refresh" buttons will have no effect.</P>

<P>텶f the source list view catalog has a different definition than the destination catalog, neither the "Transfer Selected" and "Transfer Refresh" buttons will function.</P>

<P>톀egardless of the definitions of the destination list view catalogs, the "Transfer All" buttons will first erase all destination objects, then copy the source objects.  Note that selecting "User Objects" in the "Confirm Object Replace" dialog will transfer ALL 20 Custom User Catalogs plus the normal User Objects.</P>

<P>톂he above rules apply to <A HREF="au279td.htm">Real Time Mode</A> as well.</P>
