<P><A NAME="16fu6yo"></A><B>Get object data from WWW (File Menu)</B></P>

<P>Use this command to retrieve object data from the internet and have it added directly to the library. The object data comes from various sources on the web.  The files available for download are determined dynamically when you run the Autostar Update, so you may notice different choices on different days.  All of the following sites update their data regularly, so you may find it best to refresh your ephemerides data just before an observing session.</P>

<P>·<A HREF="au22f8k.htm">Asteroids</A><U>http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/Ephemerides</U></P>

<P>·<A HREF="au20d0f.htm">Comets</A><U>http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/Ephemerides/Comets/</U></P>

<P>·<A HREF="au246t3.htm">Satellites</A><U>http://celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/</U></P>

<P>·<A HREF="au28mb3.htm">Tours</A><U>http://www.meade.com/support/auto/AutostarTourFiles/</U></P>

<P>You can select individual body types to download or all the body types. If you select all body types more than 2000 objects will be added to your library.</P>

<P>Before starting this operation you should be connected to the Internet. If you have AOL, login to AOL and then come back to the update program.</P>

<P>A dialog box will be displayed allowing you to select which objects you wish to download.  To select all objects of a given type, check the checkbox next to the category type, such as Comets or Satellites.  To download individual items only, click the + next to a category to have a list of available download files generated dynamically by querying the applicable web servers.  After selecting the objects to download, you have the following additional options to choose from:</P>

<P>·<B>Delete all existing objects first</B></P>

<P>This will delete all the object data of the specified body type before adding new data</P>

<P>·<B>Only import objects that already exist</B></P>

<P>This will effectively update the body data in your library by not adding new objects but only replacing the ones that match the names in your library.</P>

<P>After pressing OK look to the lower left corner status bar. There will be an indication of the progress of the download. When the operation is complete the <A HREF="au28yw3.htm">Library List View</A> will be updated with the new data.</P>
