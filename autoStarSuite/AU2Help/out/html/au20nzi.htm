<P><A NAME="v1ejnn"></A><B>How To Get Started Using Autostar Update</B></P>

<P>Autostar Update performs two main functions:</P>

<P>1)Loads new software into the Autostar Handbox</P>

<P>2)Transfers object menu choices such as comets, asteroids and user objects between the Autostar Handbox and the PC.</P>

<P>Before you can perform either of these functions, your Autostar Handbox must be properly connected to your Personal Computer.  If you have not already done so, you must purchase the optional <A HREF="au23a9i.htm">LX200 Interface Cable</A>, <A HREF="au21vld.htm">#505 Connector Kit</A> or <A HREF="au21vle.htm">#506 Connector Kit</A>.  Follow the instruction sheet that came with the connector kit to fully utilize the software.  The Autostar Update can be used without connecting the Autostar handbox to the PC, but you will be limited to manipulating the data on the PC only.</P>

<P><B>Loading new software into the Autostar Handbox</B></P>

<P>The Autostar Update document window opens in the <A HREF="au21apc.htm">basic</A> view.  If all you wish to do is update the software in your handbox to the latest revision, connect your computer to the internet, connect your Autostar Handbox to your PC, and click on the <A HREF="au27qci.htm">Upgrade Autostar Software Now</A> button.</P>

<P>Autostar Update then automatically checks the latest version of the software found on Meade’s Web Site (if you are connected to the internet),  also checks your local hard disk to see if a version is already stored there, and finally checks your handbox..  The versions of the software that were found then display in a dialog box, including the revision level of the software in your handbox.  Follow the prompts in the dialog boxes to complete the operation.  Note that transferring this data to your handbox takes approximately 15 - 25 minutes. <B>Caution: Do not disturb the handbox during this operation.</B></P>

<P><B>Transferring objects between the Autostar Handbox and the Personal Computer</B></P>

<P>To select this function, click on the <A HREF="au21apc.htm">Advanced View</A> button.  The window expands to show the <A HREF="au25s4q.htm">Autostar Commands</A> buttons, the <A HREF="au28yw3.htm">Library List View</A> and the <A HREF="au24xf2.htm">Handbox List View</A>.  The <A HREF="au28yw3.htm">Library List View</A> displays a list of objects that are currently in Autostar Update’s memory.  Use this list view to manipulate, sort and edit objects prior to transferring them to the Autostar Handbox.  The <A HREF="au24xf2.htm">Handbox List View</A> displays a virtual list of objects contained in the Autostar Handbox.  Build this list by transferring desired objects from the <A HREF="au28yw3.htm">Library List View</A>.  <B>Hint</B>: Sort and select the objects you wish to transfer to the Autostar Handbox for your next observing session.</P>

<P>To load data into the <A HREF="au28yw3.htm">Library List View</A>, <A HREF="au29393.htm">Open</A> an existing Autostar Update Data (*.AUD) File, or <A HREF="au26cnz.htm">Import</A> certain file types for comet, asteroid, satellite and tour data (you may find some of these files on the Meade Instruments Web Site), or the program can access the data directly from the web by using <A HREF="au24mun.htm">File-&gt;Get Object Data from WWW</A></P>

<P>Use the <A HREF="au25s4q.htm">Autostar Commands</A> buttons to <A HREF="au29s4y.htm">Connect to the Handbox</A>, and <A HREF="au20e73.htm">Send Data</A> and <A HREF="au27msy.htm">Retrieve Data</A>.  </P>
