<P>The object data in previous versions of Autostar Update were stored as separate files; one for each body type. In order to use this data it must be imported into the new library. As each file is imported it will be added to the current library. To Import follow these steps</P>

<P>1.From the menu select File-&gt;Import</P>

<P>2.Pull down &lt;Files of type&gt; and select &lt;ROM files&gt;</P>

<P>3.Select the directory that the old files were stored in by pulling down &lt;Look in&gt; and selecting &lt;Local Disk (C:)&gt; then double click on each of these directories in this order: Program Files-&gt;Meade-&gt;Autostar-&gt;Autostar Update-&gt;Ephemerides. This is the standard install directory. If you installed in a different directory then select the Ephemerides directory under your install directory.</P>

<P>4.Select the file LibAsteroids.ROM this is obviously the asteroids data.</P>

<P>5.Pull down Object Type and select Asteroid.</P>

<P>6.Click Import. The data will be added to your library.</P>

<P>7.Repeat steps 1 – 6 for each of the other Object Types.</P>

<P>8.Save the library by selecting File-&gt;Save, or File-&gt;Save As and select a name and location that you will remember. I suggest My Documents for the location type Library as the name.</P>

<P>9.Remove the old program by going to Control Panel and selecting Add Remove Programs and then select Autostar Update and click Remove. Do not remove ASU which is this program.</P>
