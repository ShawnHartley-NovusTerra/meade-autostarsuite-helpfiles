<P>A user object is ANY celestial object that a user defines with the Autostar Handbox.  The location of this object are recorded in celestial coordinates, so whenever the telescope is astronomically aligned, the user may return to that object.  This is useful for those wishing to observe celestial objects that are not currently defined in the Autostar’s database, such as newly-found comets or asteroids.</P>

<P>The Autostar II handbox also contains <A HREF="au2252w.htm">Custom User Objects</A>, which have user-defined fields.</P>
