<P><A NAME="how_to_upgrade"></A><B>How To Upgrade Your Handbox To A Different Revision Of The Software</B></P>

<P>This procedure only works for the #495 Autostar, #497 Autostar and Autostar II. There is currently no means for upgrading the software in a #494 Autostar Handbox. </P>

<P>To upgrade the handbox software: </P>

<P>1.Make sure the Handbox is properly connected to your personal computer.  A <A HREF="au23a9i.htm">P/N 07047 LX200 Interface Cable</A> or <A HREF="au21vld.htm">#505</A> Connector Kit is required to connect your Autostar Handbox to the Serial Port on your computer.  Follow the instruction sheet that came with the connector kit.  If you do not connect Autostar to the PC, you may still use the Autostar Update to download the latest handbox software from the Internet and save it to your local hard disk.</P>

<P>2.If you wish to download the latest revision of Autostar, you must establish a connection to the Internet using the protocol that you would normally use (dial-up connection, DSL, Cable Modem, etc.).  If you already have an upgrade file on your local hard disk, make it sure it is in the Ephemerides subdirectory of the installation directory and proceed.</P>

<P>3.Click on the <A HREF="au27qci.htm">Upgrade Autostar Software Now</A> button.  </P>

<P>Autostar Update automates the rest of the process, including downloading the upgrade software and transferring the data to your handbox.  You will be given several prompts, depending on the choices available to you.  If the handbox is connected, you will have the option of downloading from multiple versions of the upgrade software found on your hard drive.  If the handbox is not connected, you may still download the latest version from the internet to store on your hard drive and upgrade at a later time, but you must first specify which type of Autostar you wish to upgrade.</P>

<P><B>WARNING!</B> While the Autostar Software is being transferred to the handbox, <B>DO NOT TURN OFF THE HANDBOX OR CLOSE THE APPLICATION</B>!  Doing so will corrupt the programming of the handbox and render it inoperable.  If you should encounter any problems that render the handbox inoperable (<I>i.e.,</I> it fails to display the normal welcome screen when power is applied), you <B>must</B> use the <A HREF="au27y7m.htm">safe-loader</A> to restore the handbox.</P>

<P>Note: The "Erase User Banks" check box is available for the Autostar II only.  This option will erase all user information, including site information, owner information, user objects, telescope calibrations, etc.  Do not use this option unless you are having severe problems uploading your handbox.</P>
