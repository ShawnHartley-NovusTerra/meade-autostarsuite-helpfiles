<P><A NAME="how_to_transfer"></A><B>How To Transfer Objects To And From The Handbox And Library Collection</B></P>

<P>To select this function, you must be in <A HREF="au21apc.htm">Advanced View</A> mode.  The Advanced View window displays the <A HREF="au28yw3.htm">Library List View</A> on the left and the <A HREF="au24xf2.htm">Handbox List View</A> on the right.  </P>

<P>The <A HREF="au28yw3.htm">Library List View</A> contains the master list of objects <A HREF="au29393.htm">Loaded</A> or <A HREF="au26cnz.htm">Imported</A> from your local hard disk.  The <A HREF="au24xf2.htm">Handbox List View</A> contains the data that will be <A HREF="au20e73.htm">Sent</A> to the Autostar Handbox, or that have just been <A HREF="au27msy.htm">Retrieved</A> from the Autostar Handbox.</P>

<P>To transfer objects from one List View to the other:</P>

<P>1.Select the appropriate object type by pressing one of the 6 buttons (Asteroids, Satellites, Comets, etc.) at the top of either list.  Pressing one button from either list changes the displayed object type in BOTH lists.  <B>Note:</B> All data types are stored in the Autostar Update program at all times, but the list view only displays one object type at a time.</P>

<P>2.Select the objects from one list view that you wish to copy to the other list view.  You may select one at a time by clicking on an object with the mouse, or you may select multiple objects by holding down the shift key or CTRL key.  You may only select objects of the same type, however.</P>

<P>3.Either drag the selected items from one list view to the other by holding down the mouse button and releasing it when the objects are over the destination list view, OR click on the <A HREF="au20ujn.htm">Copy Objects</A>Button (labeled with a "-&gt;" or "&lt;-" arrow).</P>

<P><B>Note</B>: Any objects copied to the <A HREF="au24xf2.htm">Handbox List View</A> are not yet in the handbox.  You may sort the list by clicking on the desired column heading, edit objects, delete objects, or create new objects.  </P>

<P>When the <A HREF="au24xf2.htm">Handbox List View</A> contains all the objects you wish to transfer to the handbox:</P>

<P>1.Connect the Handbox to the PC using the appropriate cable kit.</P>

<P>2.Turn the telescope power on.</P>

<P>3.Click on the <A HREF="au20e73.htm">Send Data</A> button in the <A HREF="au25s4q.htm">Autostar Commands</A> button group located in the upper right of the window.  It may take several minutes to send the data, depending on how much data is being transferred.  Once the data is sent, it is automatically saved to a backup file, so you can undo any changes you by choosing the File Menu Item <A HREF="au22eat.htm">Restore Data</A>.   </P>

<P><B>Caution: </B>Sending data to the handbox erases all the objects already in the handbox, so if you do not wish to permanently lose this data, <A HREF="au22351.htm">Retrieve</A> it first, <A HREF="au23rjk.htm">Save</A> it to the hard disk, and then proceed as above.</P>
