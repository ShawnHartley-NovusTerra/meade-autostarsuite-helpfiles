<P>This function will force the handbox to perform a "garbage collection" on its user data memory.</P>

<P>During normal use of the handbox, memory is allocated to an object as needed, but when the object is destroyed, the memory is not freed up to be used for other objects.  This is not normally a problem because the size of the user memory in the Autostar II is much larger than most users’ needs.  Both the Autostar Update and the handbox perform garbage Collection automatically when it looks like the amount of available memory is starting to get low.</P>

<P>If it seems like operations with the handbox are taking an unusually long amount of time, you may wish to use this function.  The more "garbage" that is in the memory area, the longer it will take the operating system to "sift through the garbage" to get to the desired data.</P>
