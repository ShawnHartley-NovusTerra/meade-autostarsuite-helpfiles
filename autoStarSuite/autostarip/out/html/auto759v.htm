<P>The Print command allows you to make high quality hard copy versions of the currently displayed starmap.  Any selected options will also appear on the printed version.  The hard copy version is rendered to take full advantage of your printer.  The best results will be obtained by using a laser printer.</P>

<P>Due to variations in printers and in the vendor supplied printer drivers, the hard copy version will not exactly match the screen display.  Autostar Suite IP attempts to find the best fit with the given printer setup to preserve the screen view as much as possible.  You may choose to print the map in color or b/w.  If you print a color map on a black and white printer, you may get unexpected results.</P>
