<P>This command makes a copy of  each image in the current group. Each new file name is created by concatenating the string “COPY_OF_” with the original image name.  The new images are written to the same directory as the original image.  The group list is updated to point at the copies, rather than the original files. Subsequent group operations will therefore apply to the copies and not the original image files.</P>
