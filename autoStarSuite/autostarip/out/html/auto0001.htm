<P>The Image formatting section allows you to modify the image data in a number of ways.  You can lighten or darken an image, change its contrast, or run a number of sophisticated image processing functions to bring out or suppress subtle details contained in the image.</P>

<P>To access the commands you can either click on the Image File on the Menu Bar with the mouse, use the Alt key and the appropriate underlined letter from the keyboard, or, when available, click on the appropriate button from the Tool Bar.</P>

<P>Many of the image processing functions also allow for a preview so that you have the option to choose a different variation of the function , choose OK, or to Cancel the function.  The functions that offer the Preview option are: Merge, Scale, Convolution, Unsharp Masking, and RGB merge.</P>

<P>Descriptions of the Image file commands from the Menu Bar appear below. The icon from the appropriate button from the Tool Bar also appears next to the description for your reference.</P>
