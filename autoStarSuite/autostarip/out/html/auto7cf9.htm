<P>This command is used to delete multiple images. Often after processing is complete you are left with many scratch or copied images. To quickly erase them, create an image group composed of these scrap images and then select the group delete command. You be prompted to confirm your intentions. Once that is done, the images will be removed from your hard drive, but may still be available in the recycle bin.</P>
