<P>This command is used to align multiple images. When the command is selected, all of the images in the group are averaged together and displayed.  If they are slightly missaligned, stars will appear as streaks or multiples.  To align the images, draw a selection box around all the stars, or trialed star, that should be a single point.  The program will then realign and average the images together again a display the results.</P>
