<P><A NAME="52dk8cu"></A><B>Scale (View menu)</B></P>

<P>The <B>Scale</B> dialog allows you to modify the contrast and brightness of the image in a variety of ways.  Your control of the image's appearance can be as simple as a straight linear scaling or as complex as Histogram Equalization.</P>

<P>When a new image is loaded, the values in this dialog box are reset to their defaults.  This allows you to initially view the image in its un-altered state.</P>

<P>The graph displays the transformation that will be applied to the image values when the <B>OK</B> button is depressed.  The horizontal axis represents the input values to the transformation, while the vertical axis represents the resulting values.  Each axis is drawn to reflect the values of the current palette.  With the normal <B>Linear</B> transformation each input pixel corresponds to exactly the same output value, but only when Contrast = 1.0 and Brightness = 0.</P>

<P>You can think of the <B>Contrast</B> and <B>Brightness</B> controls as the variables M and B in the equation of a straight line,</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bm25.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P>where X is the input value, M is the slope of the line, B is the zero offset and Y is the resulting value.  By varying the <B>Contrast</B> control you can actually see the slope of the line changing.  A steep slope results in an image that quickly varies from black to white (high contrast), while a shallow slope (less than 1.0) produces an image which is made up mainly of gray values.  Setting the <B>Contrast</B> to a negative value produces a negative image.</P>

<P>Setting the <B>Brightness</B> control to values greater than zero brightens the image, while values less than zero will darken it.  Generally, you must use both the contrast and brightness controls together to achieve the desired results.</P>

<P>The <B>Linear</B> function sets a straight line transformation that resets the contrast and brightness values to 1.0 and 0.0 respectively.</P>

<P>The <B>Dynamic</B> function analyzes the image for its lightest and darkest values (excluding pure black and white) then sets up a linear transformation with the contrast and brightness adjusted to provide a full range image.  This is useful on images that are over or underexposed, or those that have poor contrast.</P>

<P>The <B>Exponential</B> function sets a non-linear transformation and resets both contrast and brightness.  The resulting exponential curve produces images that have lower contrast in the dark areas and higher contrast in the light areas.  This is useful for bringing out detail in the central regions of galaxies or nebulae.</P>

<P>The <B>Logarithmic</B> function produces a curve that is the inverse of the <B>Exponential</B>. It increases the contrast in the dark areas while lowering it in the bright areas.  This helps to enhance the detail in the faint arms of a galaxy.</P>

<P>The most complex transformation is <B>Histogram Equalization</B>.  Its purpose is to construct a transformation curve that shows the maximum amount of detail in the image in all areas.  This is accomplished by building a Histogram of the image (counting the number of pixels at each brightness level), then constructing a curve that tries to equalize the number of pixels in each of the resulting brightness levels.</P>

<P>The maximum number of resulting levels can be set using the scroll bar, a greater number of steps generally produces a smoother image.  This value must be set before the <B>Histogram Equalization</B> button is pressed.  The maximum value is seldom reached since the equalization process greatly reduces the number of initial gray levels.  The default value of 128 is useful in the majority of cases since most images tend to equalize to fewer than 64 steps.</P>

<P><B>Histogram Equalization</B> is useful in almost all images, but remember that the resulting curve is far from linear, so that further quantitative analysis (e.g., Magnitude determination) is impossible.</P>

<P>The <B>Posterize</B> function produces a stair stepped curve that can reduce the number of displayed values to the predefined settings.  By setting the number of steps with the scroll bar, depressing the <B>Posterize</B> button displays the resulting curve and resets the contrast and brightness values.  This feature is most useful for delineating areas of similar brightness to enhance the overall shape of an object such as a comet or nebula.</P>

<P>Before committing to the scaling function that you have selected, you can Preview the image by pressing the Preview button, you then have the option to select OK , Cancel , or try another  scaling function.</P>
