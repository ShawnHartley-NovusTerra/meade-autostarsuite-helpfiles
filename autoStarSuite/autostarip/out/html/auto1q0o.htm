<P><A NAME="3xl8_zx"></A><B>Grayscale Palette and Standard Palette</B></P>

<P>The <B>Grayscale Palette</B> and <B>Standard Palette</B> commands are used together to optimize your systems' ability to display gray scale images.  If you are running in a standard VGA display mode, these commands will be enabled.  Since these commands are not required in other display modes, they will appear disabled.</P>

<P>The standard VGA mode allows only 16 simultaneous colors, with this limitation in mind, Windows requires that these colors be set to the standards 'pure' colors, e.g. red, green, blue, magenta, etc.,  this provides only two gray values plus black and white.  To improve you capability of viewing the high resolution B/W images, Autostar Suite IP re-programs the hardware registers on the VGA board to display 16 gray values instead of 16 'pure' colors.  By selecting the standard 16 color palette in the <B>Image</B>, <B>Palette</B> menu when the Grayscale Palette is active, you will be able to view the images in 16 shades of gray</P>

<P>NOTE: The Grayscale Palette function removes all colors from the display leaving only shades of gray.  Make sure you restore the regular colors by selecting the Standard Palette before you run other color intensive applications.</P>
