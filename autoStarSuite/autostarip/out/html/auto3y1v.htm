<P><A NAME="2nf5yc"></A><B>Photometry Command (Group menu)</B></P>

<P>This command allows you to perform the same photometric measurements on all images in the group. It is designed to ease the data analysis load when many obervations of the same field of view have been taken to measure a variable star, determine air mass, or track asteroids. When this command is selected, the following dialog appears:</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bm32.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P>When the dialog appears, draw boxes around each star or object you wish to measure.  If the images have not been previously aligned, or if one of the targets, such as an asteroid or planet, are moving, you should check the <B>Recenter and Track</B> option.  Each new image is recenter all of the measurement apertures in each successive image. </P>

<P>To facilitate easy import of the result data into a spread sheet, select the <B>Columnar Format</B> option. </P>

<P>If you make a mistake during star selection, clicking <B>Clear List</B>, will allow you to start over.  When you are ready, click on <B>Process</B> and your measurements for each image will be written to the current log file.</P>
