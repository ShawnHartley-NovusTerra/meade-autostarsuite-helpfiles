<P><B>Time</B></P>

<P>The Time functions allow you to set the time and date, display the current time in a variety of formats, and select the location from which you want to observe.  You may select a time and date anywhere from January 1, 4713 B.C. to December 31, 9999 A.D..  However, you would normally select dates that correspond to your planned observing sessions.</P>

<P>If you set a date or time, Autostar Suite 's internal clock is halted and all calculations will use your chosen time and date.  If you choose to use the system time, the internal clock will again begin running and will be accessed in real-time as the system requires.</P>

<P>When Autostar Suite is communicating directly with an observatory, the observatory will provide an accurate time source for Universal Time (UT1).  When not connected, Universal Time is derived from the internal clock of the PC.</P>
