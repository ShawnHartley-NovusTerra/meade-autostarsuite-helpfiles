<P>The Set Field Sizes command displays the current sizes of the fields of view of both the guide scope and main telescope.  The fields may be either rectangular or circular; the sizes are degrees, minutes and seconds of arc.  The displayed values would be updated as soon as the communication to the observatory was established.  You may change these values as you wish to reflect your own equipment.  The values are saved between sessions so that you can plan your observing run without being connected to the telescope.</P>

<P>The field sizes can be displayed as an overlay on the starmap by selecting the Telescope Fields entry in the Starmap, Options dialog box</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bm33.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P>By selecting either Circular or Rectangular the display will change from an X/Y entry mode to diameter entry mode as appropriate.</P>

<P>Default values for popular versions of Meade equipment can be automatically calculated by selecting the finder scope, telescope, and eyepiece, CCD, or camera.</P>
