<P>The Ephemeris menu allows you to view the parameters of the ephemeral (changeable) objects in the Solar system.  The detailed parameters of each object can be viewed individually by selecting the object directly from the menu.</P>

<P>The values shown are a function of Autostar Suite 's current time value and the precision that is set in the Starmap menu.  All values are calculated using the accepted rigorous methods.  For the most accurate geocentric (Earth centered) values, choose the High precision mode.  By selecting the Topocentric precision mode, you will see the high precision values that are also corrected for the current location and elevation.</P>

<P>NOTE: The accuracy of the minor planet database decreases as the time from the 'Epoch of Osculation' increases. Autostar Suite is shipped with the most current data available at the time of packaging, but due to variations in the supply of the product, you may receive data that is somewhat outdated.  For normal applications the values are acceptable for several years, but for extreme accuracy, the data may only suffice for several weeks or months.  For highly accurate applications contact Meade Instruments to obtain an updated database.  Normally, the new data is published every six months.</P>
