<P>Once communications have been established, two other menu options become available; the Meade Setup and Control Panel.<B> </B>The <B>Autostar Setup/Shutdown</B> dialog box allows simple remote initialization or shutdown. Is also allows setting and reading of various parameters, such as time, date, location, etc.. These are much more easily entered from the PC rather than from the telescope's hand box.  In addition, the fan and field de-rotator can also be controlled.</P>
