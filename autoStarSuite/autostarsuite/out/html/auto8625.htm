<P>Autostar Suite can communicate with your telescope by a number of different methods. It can connect directly to a PC serial port with the suppled cable. It can also be configured to dial up a remotely located telescope via a dial-up modem.  It can connect to a remote or local telescope via any standard TCP/IP computer network.  Or it can allow you to use a virtual handbox for a locally connected or networked telescope.  The sub menus allow you select your connection method. </P>
