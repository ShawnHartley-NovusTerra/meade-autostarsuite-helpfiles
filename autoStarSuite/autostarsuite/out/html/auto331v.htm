<P>The appearance of the Starmap can be altered to more closely match the view seen through the telescope or in a photograph.  This is accomplished by changing the Contrast and Brightness values.</P>

<P>The <B>Contrast</B> setting changes how the star sizes are chosen based on the star's magnitude.  A high Contrast setting causes a large change in size from one magnitude to the next, while a low value causes a small size change.  Setting the Contrast to 0 results in all stars appearing the same size.</P>

<P>The <B>Brightness</B> setting determines the overall size of all of the stars.  A large value results in large stars, while a small value results in small ones.  Setting the Brightness to 0 results in all stars appearing as single points.</P>

<P>The <B>Default</B> button quickly sets both the Contrast and Brightness to values that are useful in most circumstances.</P>
