<P>This command starts the Envisage Remote Control module that allows you to remotely control Meade’s DSI, DSI II ad LPI imagers when running under Envisage on a remote PC. When the Remote Control module has started, you should see an image similar to the one below:</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bm43.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P>The Envisage uses an efficient protocol, to minimize network traffic when controlling an LPI, DSI or DSI II imager. The first step in remote imaging is to establish a connection. Enter the network name of the Host Computer in the <I>Host</I> field.  If you are using a non-standard port, you may need to change that as well. Once the Port and Host Name are correct, check the <I>Connect</I> box.  You now can control an imager talking to the Host PC.  You can change exposure times, start and stop imaging and preview live images to frame and focus.  </P>

<P>When you are using Envisage Remote Control, the full resolution image data is being saved on the host PC.  At the end of your session, you will need to download the full resolution images over the network, before you can perform any post processing.</P>
