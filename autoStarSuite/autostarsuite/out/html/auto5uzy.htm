<P>The Gregorian time and date format is the format that is normally used throughout the world.  It was established at noon on October 4, 1582 by Pope Gregory.  At that instance of time, the current Julian date was 2299160.0.  The very next instance became October 15, 1582 and the Julian date became 2299160.5.  This was done to correct for errors that had accumulated, since the previous calendar did not include leap years.  Pope Gregory's new calendar included an extra day every four years.  This is the calendar we still use today.</P>
