<P>Use this command to lock the display on a specific Azimuth and Altitude as seen by a ground based observer.  When locked on a specific Az/El, the star will show their apparent motion across the sky as time elapses.  If connected to a telescope and the “Track Scope” option is enabled, it will override this setting. </P>
