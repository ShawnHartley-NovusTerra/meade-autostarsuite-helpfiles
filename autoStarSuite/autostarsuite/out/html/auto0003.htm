<P><B>Starmap</B></P>

<P>Autostar Suite provides a highly detailed and extremely accurate map of the sky that includes stars, planets, galaxies, nebulas and other deepsky objects.  The map has a number of selectable options that allow you to generate the map in a way that best suits your needs.  Once you have configured the starmap to your requirements, you can generate a high quality hard copy version.</P>

<P>You can center the starmap on any star, deepsky object, or constellation you choose.  Or you can set the center coordinates to any Right Ascension and Declination values you desire.</P>

<P>By selecting the Coordinates button in the Options dialog, you will enable the coordinate display window in the upper right corner of the Starmap window.  This will allow you to see the actual Right Ascension (R.A.) and Declination (Dec.) values at the current cursor position.  These values will update as you move the cursor over the Starmap window.  If you have selected the Set Distance Ref. function, the display will enlarge to also show the current distance from the reference point as you move the cursor.</P>

<P>The starmap is normally drawn as a spherical projection.  That is, each object's position is calculated based on the current Zenith viewpoint and is then mapped, or projected, onto a sphere.  This results in a display that has the minimal amount of distortion around the point of interest, but, it is more computationally expensive than the flat polar or equatorial projections that are sometimes used.</P>

<P>All starmap plotting functions are implemented using 64 bit floating point numbers with 80 bit intermediate results.  This provides extremely accurate maps, even when the field of view is less than 0.00000001 degree.</P>
