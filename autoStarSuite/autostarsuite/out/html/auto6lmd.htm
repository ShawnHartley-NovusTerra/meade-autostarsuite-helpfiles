<P><A NAME="l2_m8u"></A><B>Object Selection</B></P>

<P>Displays the Object Selection dialog box.  The Object Selection feature allows you to select an object from one of Autostar Suite 's catalogs or from one of the object databases  There are four major catalogs:</P>

<P>1) Messier</P>

<P>2) NGC (New General Catalog)</P>

<P>3) IC (Index Catalog of Nebula)</P>

<P>4) SAO (Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory)</P>

<P>The Messier catalog was originated by Charles Messier (1730-1817) as objects "to be avoided while seeking comets".  It contains some of the best galaxies, clusters and nebulas.  Messier objects are given names such as, M51 or M42.  Many Messier objects are frequently called out by their NGC designations which sometimes leads to confusion. Autostar Suite translates Messier designations into NGC, with the exception of M24 and M45 (The Pleiades) which do not exist in either the NGC or IC catalogs.</P>

<P>The New General Catalog of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars was first compiled in 1888 by J.L.E Dreyer.  This catalog has been updated since its original publication and two subsequent Index Catalogs were produced.  Objects from the NGC catalog have names such as NGC 1984, while the Index Catalog objects use names such as IC 939.</P>

<P>The SAO star catalog contains position and other useful information on most of the known stars.  It was compiled by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.  The standard version of the catalog shipped with Autostar Suite contains all stars down to magnitude 8.0, over 45,000.  If the SAO extensions are installed, you will have access to approximately 270,000 additional stars from magnitude 8.01 to beyond 9.5.</P>

<P>In addition to the major catalogs, there are also a number of object databases:</P>

<P>Solar system Named asteroids</P>

<P>Comets Numbered asteroids</P>

<P>Common stars User objects</P>

<P>Constellations User planetoids</P>

<P>These databases allow you to select from a variety of objects.  The Asteroid database is quite large and may cause a delay while loading all of the names.</P>

<P>Pushing the Description button displays the Object Description dialog box that show all of the parameters of the selected object.  Pushing OK sets the Zenith coordinates to the position of the selected object.</P>
