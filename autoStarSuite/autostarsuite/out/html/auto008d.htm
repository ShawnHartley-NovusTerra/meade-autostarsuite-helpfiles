<P><A NAME="9w7vqm"></A><B>Protocol (Telescope menu)</B></P>

<P>There are several methods of communication between Autostar Suite and the telescope:</P>

<P>Via CommPort</P>

<P>Via Modem</P>

<P>Via Network</P>

<P>Via Remote Handbox</P>

<P>In the first three modes you computer will automatically drive the telescope to any specified R.A. and Dec. coordinate. Autostar Suite supports many of the telescope's commands, but uses the programs values for R.A. and Dec. instead of the telescope's internal database when slewing to an object.  This provides the opportunity to access any custom object or sky location you choose.</P>

<P>The communications link is automatically started when the protocol is selected.  To terminate the link select the <B>[none]</B> option.</P>

<P><B>Remote Handbox</B></P>

<P>It you use the Remote Handbox protocol you will get a dialog similar to the one shown in the figure below:</P>

<P>This allows you access to all of the controls of the telescope as though you were holding its handcontroller.  To speed accessing Autostar menus, you can use the menu tree on the left side of the display to directly invoke a menu functions by double clicking it.  You may use your mouse to press the virtual buttons. Data entry can be performed directly from the keyboard using the numeric keys, arrows, backspace and enter.  The Esc key function as the mode key during keyboard entry.</P>

<P><B>Telescope Speech Output</B></P>

<P>If you click the Enable Speech check box in the lower left for the dialog, everything displayed on the handbox will be spoken using the sound card on your PC.  The allows you to hear comentary on deepsky object and tours while lookling through the eye piece.</P>
