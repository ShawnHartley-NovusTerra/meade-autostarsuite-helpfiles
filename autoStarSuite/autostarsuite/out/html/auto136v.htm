<P>The Animate Starmap command allows you to redraw the ephemeral objects (Planets, Comets and Asteroids) in rapid succession while incrementing the date and time between each redraw.  A trail is left behind the object as it moves.</P>

<P>To begin animation, first select the Step Time and the units, either days, hours, minutes or seconds, then press the Start button.  The starmap will begin updating the positions of all the ephemeral objects that were selected in the Options dialog box.  While the animation is running you may change the step time or the units, or change the direction.  Pressing the Stop button halts the animation, leaving the trails displayed on the screen.  You may click on any of the trails to determine which object produced the trail.  Note that the position that will be displayed in Object Description dialog box will show the coordinates of the object at the current date and time, NOT the date and time of the position in the trail.</P>

<P>The Reverse option allows you to clear the display, draw the objects in their normal starting positions, then begin animation from the last position calculated.  This is useful when looking for conjunctions or occultations.</P>

<P>You may also set the Autostar Suite time value to the time of the current animation step.  This allows you to 'freeze' the time of an event such as on occultation.  At anytime during the animation you may click on the Update Current Time button.  This will copy the displayed time value from the Animation dialog box into the system time value, just as though you had entered the time directly from the Set Time &amp; Date function.</P>
