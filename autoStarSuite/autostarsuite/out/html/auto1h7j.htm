<P>The Starmap is normally drawn in a <B>Spherical</B> projection.  That is, each point is calculated in X,Y, and Z then projected (mapped) onto a sphere.  This projection produces a display that has minimal distortion at the center of the display, independent of the actual position of the object on the celestial sphere.</P>

<P>The spherical projection requires a substantial amount of processor time to generate a map, but the final results far outweigh the small increase in display time.  Other simple projections are sometimes seen in other programs.  These are used to increase the apparent rendering time of the map, but they introduce significant amounts of distortion. Autostar Suite uses only the most accurate display techniques.</P>

<P>A variant of the spherical projection is the <B>Azimuthal Equidistant </B>projection.  This projection differs from the spherical in that the Z coordinates of the point are projected onto a flat plane, rather than onto a sphere.  The resulting projection gives a more satisfactory display of the entire sky, especially near the horizon.  However, the objects at the center of the map are somewhat smaller than objects near the horizontal.  Use this projection when trying to find constellations or to orient yourself with the sky, but use the Spherical projection when zooming into a smaller area of the sky.</P>

<P>The R.A., Dec. and Dist. values shown in the Coordinate Display are correct in either projection.</P>
