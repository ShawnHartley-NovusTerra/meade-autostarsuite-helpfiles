<P>The Magnitudes dialog box allows you to set the range of object magnitudes that will be displayed by the Starmap.  The default values are -5.0 for the brightest objects and 22.00 for the dimmest.  All displayed objects are affected by these settings, with the exception of the Sun and Moon which are always shown if the Planets are enabled.</P>

<P>Many of the deepsky objects do not have assigned magnitudes, Autostar Suite defaults these objects to magnitude 22.00 when they are being displayed.</P>

<P>Alternatively, you can check the Auto Contrast box.  When this box is check the range of magnitudes that are displayed depends on how wide the field of view is. In general, only brighter objects are displayed on larger fields of view to assure that the star mad does not become too cluttered to be useful. As you zoom further and the field narrows, fainter and fainter objects are revealed. </P>
