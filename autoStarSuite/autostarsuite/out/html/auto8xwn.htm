Autostar Suite cannot determine if there are any mechanical interferences that may develop as the telescope is moved, such as, a camera extending to far from the back of the telescope.  As a result, it is possible to move the telescope into positions that may cause serious damage to the equipment or personal physical injury!</P>

<P>DO NOT MOVE THE TELESCOPE IN REMOTE CONTROL MODE WITHOUT A PERSON STANDING BY TO MANUALLY OVERRIDE THE REMOTE COMMAND IN THE EVENT THAT THE TELESCOPE BEGINS MOVING IN A MANNER THAT COULD CAUSE EQUIPMENT DAMAGE OR PERSONAL INJURY.  THIS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED BY USING THE TELESCOPE'S KEYPAD OR BY REMOVING POWER TO THE TELESCOPE .</P>
