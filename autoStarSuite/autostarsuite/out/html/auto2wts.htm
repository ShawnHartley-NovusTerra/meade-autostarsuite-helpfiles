<P>When you check the “Server Net” box, Autostar Suite stars monitoring the network for users running Autostar Suite application on a remote PC that wish to operate your telescope/observatory.  If one of them attempts a connection, they will be prompted for a password.  <B><I>It is critical you configure your password</I></B> if you intend to put your telescope on a network.  This is the only way to prevent unauthorized users from accessing and improperly using your equipment. </P>

<P>Once their access has been verified with by password, their connection will be completed and they will be able to operate the telescope from a copy of Autostar Suite running on a remote computer. </P>

<P>Access to the telescope is vial a “TCP/IP Ports”. The default port range  is 5400 through 5410. This can be changed, this another way to imrpove the security of your telescope.  It also may be necessary to change the port the allow the telescope to be accessed behind some firewalls. If you are having difficulty, you should contact your network administrator for assistance in configuring the port.</P>

<P>When you ckech the “Serve Web” box, Autostar Suite starts its telescope web server.  This web server allows anyone with a Java enabled web browser to monitor, and with the correct passwords control your observatory.  This ability makes it easy to share your observatory without requiring remote users to install special software on their computers.</P>
